TARDIS_Warp_Mod
===============

Retextures the beam up/down animation in the game starbound

This is my first mod, so I deiced to keep it simple. This mod simply changes the animation used for beaming up to the ship and beaming down to the planet to an animation of the TARDIS fading in and out.

I made this mod because my Significant other and I both love Doctor Who and I wanted to get into modding. Anyway I figured it would be a nice touch to have the TARDIS as your transportation between your ship and the planet.

Hope you like it.
